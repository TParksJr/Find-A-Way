# Group-Project-1
This was the first of three group projects as part of the University of Toronto's Coding Bootcamp. The app is called Find-A-Way and it is designed to allow users to compare the cost of driving and parking as compared to taking an Uber. Currently the app is only completely functional when using US addresses. Future development will include expanding the core functionality to Canada (and ideally the rest of the world), as well as adding a comparison for Lyft in addition to Uber. The group members involved in this project are: vidhi27, amertoukan, rajssandhu and myself (tparksjr).
